# ISO25012-Data Quality
The Data Quality characteristics are classified in two main categories: Inherent Data Quality and System-Dependent Data Quality. 

| Main category | Sub category | Description | 
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| Only Inherent Data Quality |  Accuracy | The degree to which data has attributes that correctly represent the true value of the intended attribute of a concept or event in a specific context of use. |
| Only Inherent Data Quality | Completeness | The degree to which subject data associated with an entity has values for all expected attributes and related entity instances in a specific context of use.|
| Only Inherent Data Quality | Consistency | The degree to which data has attributes that are free from contradiction and are coherent with other data in a specific context of use. It can be either or both among data regarding one entity and across similar data for comparable entities. | 
| Only Inherent Data Quality | Credibility |The degree to which data has attributes that are regarded as true and believable by users in a specific context of use. Credibility includes the concept of authenticity (the truthfulness of origins, attributions, commitments). | 
| Only Inherent Data Quality | Currentness | The degree to which data has attributes that are of the right age in a specific context of use.| 
| More Inherent Data Quality but also System-Dependent Data Quality | Accessibility | The degree to which data can be accessed in a specific context of use, particularly by people who need supporting technology or special configuration because of some disability. | 
| More Inherent Data Quality but also System-Dependent Data Quality | Compliance|The degree to which data has attributes that adhere to standards, conventions or regulations in force and similar rules relating to data quality in a specific context of use. | 
| More Inherent Data Quality but also System-Dependent Data Quality | Confidentiality|  The degree to which data has attributes that ensure that it is only accessible and interpretable by authorized users in a specific context of use. Confidentiality is an aspect of information security (together with availability, integrity) as defined in ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004.| 
| More Inherent Data Quality but also System-Dependent Data Quality | Efficiency| The degree to which data has attributes that can be processed and provide the expected levels of performance by using the appropriate amounts and types of resources in a specific context of use. | 
| More System-Dependent Data Quality but also Inherent Data Quality | Precision| The degree to which data has attributes that are exact or that provide discrimination in a specific context of use.| 
| More System-Dependent Data Quality but also Inherent Data Quality | Traceability| The degree to which data has attributes that provide an audit trail of access to the data and of any changes made to the data in a specific context of use.| 
| More System-Dependent Data Quality but also Inherent Data Quality | Understandability |  The degree to which data has attributes that enable it to be read and interpreted by users, and are expressed in appropriate languages, symbols and units in a specific context of use.
Some information about data understandability are provided by metadata.| 
| Only System-Dependent Data Quality | Availability| The degree to which data has attributes that enable it to be retrieved by authorized users and/or applications in a specific context of use.| 
| Only System-Dependent Data Quality | Portability| The degree to which data has attributes that enable it to be installed, replaced or moved from one system to another preserving the existing quality in a specific context of use.| 
| Only System-Dependent Data Quality | Recoverability| The degree to which data has attributes that enable it to maintain and preserve a specified level of operations and quality, even in the event of failure, in a specific context of use.|
