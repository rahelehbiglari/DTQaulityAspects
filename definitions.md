Definitions:\\
\paragraph{Accuracy}
The degree to which data has attributes that correctly represent the true value of the intended attribute of a concept or event in a specific context of use.
Completeness
The degree to which subject data associated with an entity has values for all expected attributes and related entity instances in a specific context of use.

\paragraph{Consistency}
The degree to which data has attributes that are free from contradiction and are coherent with other data in a specific context of use. It can be either or both among data regarding one entity and across similar data for comparable entities.
\paragraph{Credibility}
The degree to which data has attributes that are regarded as true and believable by users in a specific context of use. Credibility includes the concept of authenticity (the truthfulness of origins, attributions, commitments).

\paragraph{Currentness}
The degree to which data has attributes that are of the right age in a specific context of use.
\paragraph{Accessibility}
The degree to which data can be accessed in a specific context of use, particularly by people who need supporting technology or special configuration because of some disability.

\paragraph{Compliance}
The degree to which data has attributes that adhere to standards, conventions or regulations in force and similar rules relating to data quality in a specific context of use.
\paragraph{Confidentiality}
The degree to which data has attributes that ensure that it is only accessible and interpretable by authorized users in a specific context of use. Confidentiality is an aspect of information security (together with availability, integrity) as defined in ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004.

\paragraph{Efficiency}
The degree to which data has attributes that can be processed and provide the expected levels of performance by using the appropriate amounts and types of resources in a specific context of use.

\paragraph{Precision}
The degree to which data has attributes that are exact or that provide discrimination in a specific context of use.

\paragraph{Traceability}
The degree to which data has attributes that provide an audit trail of access to the data and of any changes made to the data in a specific context of use.

\paragraph{Understandability}
The degree to which data has attributes that enable it to be read and interpreted by users, and are expressed in appropriate languages, symbols and units in a specific context of use.
Some information about data understandability are provided by metadata.
\paragraph{Availability}
The degree to which data has attributes that enable it to be retrieved by authorized users and/or applications in a specific context of use.

\paragraph{Portability}
The degree to which data has attributes that enable it to be installed, replaced or moved from one system to another preserving the existing quality in a specific context of use.

\paragraph{Recoverability}
The degree to which data has attributes that enable it to maintain and preserve a specified level of operations and quality, even in the event of failure, in a specific context of use.
